Erlware Commons
===============

Introduction
------------

Erlware commons can best be described as an extension to the stdlib
application that is distributed with Erlang. These are things that we
at Erlware have found useful for production applications but are not
included with the distribution. We hope that as things in this library
prove themselves useful, they will make their way into the main Erlang
distribution. However, whether they do or not, we hope that this
application will prove generally useful.

Goals for the project
---------------------

* Generally Useful Code
* High Quality
* Well Documented
* Well Tested
